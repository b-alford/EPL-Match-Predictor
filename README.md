# EPL-Match-Predictor-
This project involves predicting English Premier League (EPL) match outcomes using machine learning. I scraped match data from multiple seasons using Python, requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas, and organized it into a structured DataFrame. A scikit-learn model was trained to predict match results, using various historical statistics as predictors. The data collection and prediction processes were automated, enabling real-time analysis and improvement. This project showcases skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and applying machine learning to real-world sports data for forecasting match outcomes.
